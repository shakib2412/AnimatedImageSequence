# Animated Image Sequence with Background Music

## Overview
This project demonstrates a simple animated sequence using the EasyX library in C++. It cycles through a set of images to create an animation effect, displays a static background image, and plays looping background music. This example is useful for understanding basic animation techniques, image handling, and multimedia integration in C++ applications.

## Features
- **Animation Loop:** Smoothly cycles through a set of images to create an animation effect.
- **Background Music:** Integrates continuous background music playback.
- **Transparent Image Handling:** Utilizes custom function to draw images with transparency.
- **Window Management:** Configures a graphical window with custom dimensions.
- **Resource Management:** Demonstrates the loading and unloading of multimedia resources.

---

## Technical Details
- **Language Used:** C++ with EasyX graphics library for rendering.
- **Libraries and APIs:**
  - **EasyX:** Used for creating the window, handling graphics, and animations.
  - **Windows Multimedia API:** Used for background music control.

## How to Run
Ensure you have the EasyX library set up in your development environment and that your system is capable of compiling C++ code with multimedia features.

1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Animated-Image-Sequence.git
2. Open the project in your C++ IDE or compiler setup.
3. Compile and run `Animation.cpp`.

## File Structure
- **Animation.cpp:** Contains all the operational logic of the animation and music control.
- **Images:** Includes a series of images (`girl0.png` to `girl6.png`) used in the animation.
- **Music:** Contains the background music file (`game_music.mp3`).
